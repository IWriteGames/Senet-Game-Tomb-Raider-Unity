## About me

Hi! I write games and I like it! I'm Alex and welcome to my Github! I'm Gamedev and Gamedesigner and I upload my projects to Github to share them and discuss how they are programmed, which you will find later in this archive.

The reason is that I like my public repositories to be educational first and foremost. In the README you will find hints on how to improve the code!

If you like what I do, please follow me on my social networks!

## About the project

The version of this branch is version 0.1

This project is a puzzle that originally appeared in the Tomb Raider The Last Revelation.
The object of the game is to get your three pieces to the end of the board, following a set of rules which are available within the game.

I modelled the game entirely with Blender 3 except for the enemy, which I took from Mixamo

## About the development and improvements

Before looking at the code, it is very important that you read this section. The code is perhaps the worst you can find on Github. It is not a joke.

When I created the project, the idea was as follows. Don't follow any rules, code as needed, correct as errors arise and work as you go along.

Why? Because I thought it was a good idea to show a project created with the worst practices and then refactor the whole project, adding improvements to the project itself to show that it is a good idea to follow good coding practices.

You can find the finished project in the main branch
