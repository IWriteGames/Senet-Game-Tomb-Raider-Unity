## About me

Hi! I write games and I like it! I'm Alex and welcome to my Github! I'm Gamedev and Gamedesigner and I upload my projects to Github to share them and discuss how they are programmed, which you will find later in this archive.

The reason is that I like my public repositories to be educational first and foremost. In the README you will find hints on how to improve the code!

If you like what I do, please follow me on my social networks!

## About the project

The version of this branch is version 1.0.

This project is a puzzle that originally appeared in the Tomb Raider The Last Revelation.
The object of the game is to get your three pieces to the end of the board, following a set of rules which are available within the game.

I modelled the game entirely with Blender 3 except for the enemy, which I took from Mixamo

## About the development and improvements

In this version, the code has been refactored and improvements have been added to the game, such as music and simple animations for the board pieces. In addition, a main menu and a credits panel have been added.

Thanks to the refactoring, several bugs have been fixed and a small tool has been created to debug the game while programming. But have all the bugs been fixed?

But... by creating a main menu, it is now possible to close the game from the main menu and from the game menu. Is it necessary to have two functions to close the game? And does the code work in all cases? Could the code and the use of some variables be further refactored? In addition, some graphical improvements could be added to the project: wouldn't it look better if there was a small explosion when a stone was destroyed?
